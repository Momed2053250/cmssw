An exception of category 'Configuration' occurred while
   [0] Constructing the EventProcessor
Exception Message:
MessageLogger  PSet: 
AlpakaService is an unrecognized name for a PSet
MessageLogger  PSet: 
CUDAService is an unrecognized name for a PSet

The above are from MessageLogger configuration validation.
In most cases, these involve lines that the logger configuration code
would not process, but which the cfg creator obviously meant to have effect.
